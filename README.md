# üõ†Ô∏è How to Run This Jekyll Project Locally (Windows)

This guide helps you install and run this Jekyll project step-by-step using Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll on Windows.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Windows OS
- Ruby (install via RubyInstaller)
- Git (optional but recommended)

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

1. **Download and Install Ruby**
   - Visit https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
   - Download the latest version of Ruby+Devkit (e.g., Ruby+Devkit 3.x.x).
   - Run the installer.
   - ‚úÖ Check the box "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" during setup.
   - After installation, a terminal will open for MSYS2 setup. Press `Enter` to proceed with the default option.

2. **Verify Ruby Installation**
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or VS Code Terminal), and run:
     ```bash
     ruby -v
     ```
   - You should see something like: `ruby 3.x.xpXXX (date) [x64-mingw32]`

3. **Install Bundler and Jekyll**
   - Still in the terminal, run:
     ```bash
     gem install bundler jekyll
     ```

4. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
   - Example:
     ```bash
     cd E:\D_BackUp\template\gsurma.github.io
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure the directory contains a file called `Gemfile`.
   - Then run:
     ```bash
     bundle install
     ```

6. **Run the Jekyll Server**
   - Start the local development server with:
     ```bash
     bundle exec jekyll serve
     ```

7. **Open the Site in Your Browser**
   - Visit: http://localhost:4000

## üß© Common Issues

- **Could not locate Gemfile**
  - You're in the wrong folder. Use `cd` to move into the project directory that contains the `Gemfile`.

- **‚Äòruby‚Äô is not recognized**
  - Ruby wasn‚Äôt added to your PATH. Reinstall Ruby and make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation.

- **Permission errors during gem install**
  - Try reopening the terminal as Administrator.
